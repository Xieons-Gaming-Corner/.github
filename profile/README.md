Greetings from Xieon's Gaming Corner! We are more than just a gaming community; we're a diverse group of gamers, hobbyists, artists, and developers united to create memorable experiences. Our community is supported by our dedicated staff, and we appreciate any contributions from our members.
## About Us 🎮

* Xieon's Gaming Corner is a vibrant community that brings gamers together across various platforms, genres, games, countries, sexes, ages, and races, and we are proud of our diversity because, at the end of the day, our differences don't mean anything - it's whoever gets the W that matters.

* We do not consider ourselves a typical "family-friendly" server or organization. XGC welcomes members of all ages 13 and above, and users 18 and above are welcome to participate in our XGC After Dark Section. The reason we are not "family-friendly" is that we do not censor things such as curse words from our public channels or dark humor.

* XGC is based out of the United States, so we must follow certain guidelines, and minors under the age of 13 cannot use our services, including Discord and Twitch.

## XGC Management Staff 👥

Meet the leaders shaping the XGC experience:

* **⭐ Xieon [Owner and Founder]**
* **⭐ Rich [Co-Owner]**
* **⭐ Mike [Admin and Head of XGC Graphics]**
* **⭐ Nyx [Twitch Head Moderator and Admin Support]**
* **⭐ Hammersmith [Head of XGC's Pokemon Go Community & Admin Support]**

All staff members have a ⭐ leading their server nickname and trailing brackets [ ] with their title:

* **Green usernames** for the highest-ranking management.
* *Red usernames* for management staff.
* _Blue usernames_ for all other staff, including full staff, moderators, retired staff with permissions, and whitelisted staff from other servers.

For real-time interaction, spot the green, red, or blue usernames in our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/xieon). Our management team operates in a hierarchical order, ensuring a smooth and exciting experience for our members.
## XGC Featured Games 🕹️
